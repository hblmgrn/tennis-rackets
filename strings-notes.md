# Tennis Talk Ramblings









### Thread about Hybrids: 

The Combo I enjoyed the most with bigger frames for polys with crazy feel for years was
**Weiss Cannon UC** @ 40lbs w/ **Scorpion/PP Concept** (same thing) 1.23mm X @ 35lbs
and **TB 1.35mm** @ 40lbs a close 2nd but 1st by my colleges and customers.

**Kirschbaum Max Power 17g** @48lb. It's a perfect match for this racquet. I can take big   

strung with **Weiss Cannon Black 5 Edge**  


### Honorable mention to my Top-10 strings so far

**L-Tec Premium Meteor Pro 1.25**: played great with different balls, different levels of intensity and all shorts of hitting partners  
**Dyreex Super Tour 1.25: 4G clone**, immediate response, tons of control, excellent for flat hitters, durable and the by far the best price/performance ratio  
**Oehms Alu Pearl Rough 1.21**: 80%-Alu Power-feel clone with better durability, super cheap, I would definitely buy a reel for a part-time stringing business  
**Stringlab Orbitour Gold / Isospeed Rexxxer (felt identical)** 1.24/1.28: both goldmine strings, immediate response, liked the Gold better for the looks of it!  
**Stringlab Orbitour Silver 1.15/1.36**: rubbery/buttery texture, noticable dwell-time, super dialed-in, great on 16x20  
**L-Tec Premium Celeste 1.20**: 85-90% Alu Power feel, larger sweet-spot, performed much above average in everything  
**Topspin Cyber Flash 1.25**: above average in every aspect, uncomfortable when playing with medium intensity, needs to be played at a fast pace  
**Kirschbaum Xplosive Speed 1.23**: comfortable, I liked it a lot on the Tecnifibre TF40 315 16*19  
**Kirschbaum Max Power 1.20**: buttery feel, low power, 1st string used in a 98 sq inch will always be a great memory!  
**String Kong Orango Raw 1.28**: comforable, slick and with very nice access top-spin  
**Luxilon 4G 1.25**: first-hand pro gear experience, ideal for tight string patterns and small head sizes (no string movement), just excellent on flat hitting and backhand slices, durable, not in my top 10 because of its high cost...
